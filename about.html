                    <h2>LEAD Ranger Program</h2>
                    <p>Simple skills training for Rangers saves lives, saves lives wildlife and saves money.A single Ranger Trained in anti-poaching, intelligence
					 gathering, tracking, first aid and community engagement techniques is more likely to safely apprehend poachers, survive wild animal enconters, prevent the killing
					  of target specialsand return home to their families . if this is what one Ranger can achieve then imagine what 1000 Rangers trained in the very latest
					   techniques could achieve <br><br>
                      we did.
					 The LEAD Ranger program takes the training of a trainer idea to the next level. Together with our conservation partners in the field 
					, we've invested in an innovative training curriculum thst fosters leadership and coaching to enable hihgly skilled Rangers to pass on this
                     knowledge to the new generation of Rangers . We've also invested in a simple low cost app that keeps Rangers up-to-date with the latest
                     techniques. We've done this knowing that creating a legacy of highly skilled Ranger trainers builds a network of conservation support around some 
                      of our most threatened eco-system, and promises a brighter future for the calls these places home.
                        lEAD rangers are difference.
