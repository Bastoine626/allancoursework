                    <h1>The Thin green line foundation </h1>
                    <p>The thin green line foundation was founded in the 90's with the support and donation from different organisation in the world e.g united nation and donation
					from some the rich personel,the aim of this organisation was to help the rangers across the world who have died while on duty .
					This has encouraged most of the rangers to work hard and since they are motivated in there respective game parks across the world,it emphasized on helping
					the orphans of the deceased on like educating most of there children and employing them in the fileds of their parents to keep the active and as there parents.
					In other words the president of the orgnasition has done far across the world, cause many have benefited from it and doing well till todate.
                       <br><br>
                     The flow-on effects of having unsupported and at-risk Rangers are considerable and  often dire for wildlife, for fragile ecosystem, for the families of fallen 
					 rangers and for the communities in which they live'
					 The thin green line foundation's projects are firmly focused on supporting Rangers' needs, with emphasis on those in low-income countries and conflict zone
					 . All projects fit with in theThe<mark> Thin Green Line Foundation's</mark> 4 pillars, which you can learn more about below.

                    <p>Simple skills training for Rangers saves lives, saves lives wildlife and saves money.A single Ranger Trained in anti-poaching, intelligence
					 gathering, tracking, first aid and community engagement techniques is more likely to safely apprehend poachers, survive wild animal enconters, prevent the killing
					  of target specialsand return home to their families . if this is what one Ranger can achieve then imagine what 1000 Rangers trained in the very latest
					   techniques could achieve
					<br><br>
                     we did.
					 The LEAD Ranger program takes the training of a trainer idea to the next level. Together with our conservation partners in the field 
					, we've invested in an innovative training curriculum thst fosters leadership and coaching to enable hihgly skilled Rangers to pass on this
                     knowledge to the new generation of Rangers . We've also invested in a simple low cost app that keeps Rangers up-to-date with the latest
                     techniques. We've done this knowing that creating a legacy of highly skilled Ranger trainers builds a network of conservation support around some 
                      of our most threatened eco-system, and promises a brighter future for the calls these places home.
                        lEAD rangers are difference.

			poaching instead of repairing old boots or recovering from malaria. Under our new Ranger care Box initiative, for just $1000 AUD we can equip a 10-person
             anti-poaching Ranger patrol team in Africa or Asia with the critical gaer they need. make it happen with donation			</p>
